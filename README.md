# MyPlace-Exam
CodeAcademy Final Test - Social Puppy Site.
Made in C# .Net Core. Followed with N-Tier Architecture: Presentation Layer, Services, Repository and Models, as well dependency injection.

User can register, login, create post, make it private. There is search functionality where user can search for post from specific User.
As well user can manage his post(CRUD functionality). If the post is private it will not showup on the front page. Front page has all posts from all users(unless they are private).
